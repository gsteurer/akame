# Project Title

## Purpose 

Sandbox for implementing game engine constructs such as pathfinding algos, entity management, message passing, collision detection, rendering, etc.  

## Namesake

Project is titled 'akame', which I'm pretty sure means 'red-eye', so-called because I work on it off hours.
